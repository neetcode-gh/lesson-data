# Data Structures and Algorithms Glossary (for Coding Interviews)


This article includes the most common terms you will encounter in DSA interviews.

Knowing and understanding these beforehand can save you a significant amount of time when solving problems in live interviews.

| Overlapping Subproblems | When the same subproblems are solved multiple times |
| 1-Dimensional | The result for the current state only depends on one previous state or a linear history, e.g. Fib |
| 2-Dimensional | The problem depends on two varying factors, often two strings, two sequences, or two indices |
| Top Down | Start from the final problem and recursively break it into smaller subproblems |
